"""
The Composite Design Pattern is a structural pattern that allows you to model objects in a tree-like structure,
    where you can interact with individual objects (called Leaf) and combinations of objects (called Composite).
This pattern enables you to easily create a hierarchy of objects and perform operations uniformly on all of them.

Main Components of the Composite Pattern:

    Component: A common interface for all objects in the composition, whether they are individual objects (Leaf) or composite objects.
    Leaf: Individual objects that have no subcomponents.
    Composite: Composite objects that can contain Leaf objects or other Composite objects.


"""
# Letâ€™s assume we want to design a system for managing files and folders:
# Both files and folders can perform similar operations, such as displaying information, but folders can also contain other files and subfolders.
